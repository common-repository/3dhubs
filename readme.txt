== Description ==

Displays a 3DHubs button in the sidebar or directly in a text field.

**Widget**

You can add the widget to any widget-enabled area in your theme. There are three fields to configure the widget:

* Title: Something like 'Check out my cool hub on 3DHubs.com'

* Link: this should directly point to your hub or any hub of your choice. For me this would be https://www.3dhubs.com/karlsruhe/hubs/christian/3dprint

* Free text: Maybe you need to explain in two lines what 3DHubs is. It will be placed below the button.

**Shortcode**

The shortcode [3DHubs] enabled the button in the normal text sections (article, page etc.). The URL for the shortcode linking to a hub can be set in the settings page.

== Installation ==

This plugin can be installed like the most wordpress plugins: with the tool in the dashboard or by uploading the zip file to the server (via dashboard or directly in the plugin directory). If the installation fails check if you can install other plugins, even if there are already some installed (maybe wordpress can't write to the disk anymore...).
